# Smart Photo Album

In this project, I implemented a photo album web application that can be searched using natural language through both text and voice.

### Description
The photo album is a scalable web application designed and deployed using AWS services including Cloud Formation, CodePipeline, S3, Amazon Lex, Opensearch Service, API gateway. CI/CD DevOps pipeline is used to automate the build, test and deploy phases. The application allows users to make search requests, display the search results resulting from the query as well as upload new photos. The user is also given a choice to use either voice or text to perform the search queries.
